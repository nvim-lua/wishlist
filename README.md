# wishlist
A public catalogue of Lua plugins Neovim users would like to see exist. See the [projects page](https://github.com/nvim-lua/wishlist/projects/1) for the full list!

## Contributing
If you have an idea for a Lua plugin, or know of an existing plugin implementing one of the ideas listed here, please make an issue!

Plugin ideas are catalogued at the [projects page](https://github.com/nvim-lua/wishlist/projects/1)
for this repo.

If you also want one of the plugins listed here to exist, please consider starting an
implementation! You can add a link to your work-in-progress to the relevant idea's section via a PR
(which will also help track which plugins are being worked on on the projects page).

A wish becomes "granted" when there exists a feature-complete, stable plugin implementing the wish's
idea. See below for a list of granted wishes!
